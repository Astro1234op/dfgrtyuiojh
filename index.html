            <h1>Hi I am Pratyush Debnath</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>I am very good in web development, coding, astronomy etc.</h2>
            <br>
            <p> Hello Guys, I am Pratyush Debnath studying in grade 7 , Sri Krishna Mission School, Tripura. I am very interested in astronomy, coding, web-development, designing things etc. I want to become a astronomer and a teacher to help students to know about Astronomy, etc. I am a whitehat student well experienced in block codes, text-codes etc. My hobby is observing the night sky, the stars, galaxies and many more. I think you will like to read my website , read and enjoy.

            <h3>What are Neutron Stars ?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>When an enormous star destroyed known as supernova explosion. In that case, one of two things may happen. It may crush the core of the dead star with its own gravity, shrinking until it becomes more than an atom and becomes a black hole. And if the star is much smaller than that star producing a black hole, it will become a neutron star and its shape will become a city.A neutron star is a collapsed core of a giant star that is so much dense, excluding a black hole. Neutron Stars are the densest stars known and can pack the mass of the whole Sun in only the area of the London city. All Neutron Stars spins at a furious rate. Some Neutron Stars spin at a speed of almost 716 times per second and producing beams of radiation from their poles. Neutron Stars that flash in a duration of exact time are called pulsars shown in the above picture.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>What are Pulsars ?</h4>
            <p>Astronomers have discovered around 2,000 pulsars (flashing neutron stars). The first pulsar was spotted in 1967.

                This Neutron Stars have a powerful magnetic field and produces radiation beams from their magnetic poles. As the stars spin around its axis of rotation, the radiation beams when sweep across the sky, causing them pulses when we saw them that’s why it is named as Pulsars.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Size, Temperature and Density ?</h5>
            <br>
            <p>The Size of a neutron star is about 10-20 km wide. Neutron Stars is big enough for a city. Compared to their size to other Stars they are tiny. But their density is so high, and the gravity is too powerful–an average if one person stands on a Neutron Stars he will weigh up to 7 billion tones.
                The material through which the Neutron Star is formed is so dense that if we take one teaspoon of the material of Neutron Star, it will weigh up to the whole population of the world and if we take the material size up to a football, it will weigh up to 5 trillion tones same as the Mount Everest</p>
